# Contributing

Please send me patches. I want this to be a community project.

## Reporting issues and suggesting features

For now, we'll use Github's issue tracker and pull request tools. To report
bugs and suggest new feature use the [issue tracker](issues).

## Code contributions

If you have some code which you would like to be merged, then open a
[pull request](pulls). Please create atomic commits with descriptive
commit messages.

## Branches

next will be the branch for commits that will be pulled into the master
branch.
