# Contributing

Please send me patches. I want this to be a community project.

## Reporting issues and suggesting features

For now, we'll use Github's issue tracker and pull request tools. To report
bugs and suggest new feature use the [issue tracker](issues).

## Code contributions

If you have some code which you would like to be merged, then open a
[pull request](pulls). 

* See
  [Documentation/coding_guidelines.md](https://github.com/patrickspencer/gex)
  before submitting a patch
* Fork the next branch
* Make atomic commits with descriptive commit messages.

## Branches

next will be the branch for commits that will be pulled into the master
branch.
