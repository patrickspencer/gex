Git Explorer

This is an implemenation of the emacs package
[Magit](https://github.com/magit/magit) but for the command line. It's based
on the libgit2 and ncurses libraries.

If you haven't used Magit before then just know that it's a porcelain for Git
commands. It's a more visually way to interact with Git.

Reason's for making this:

1. The magit package is awesome but I have to open emacs everytime I want to
   use it. Emacs itself isn't bad it just takes a second or two to open it.
2. I want to learn C. This should tell you something about whether you should
   bet your life on the quality of the source code (probably not).
3. I wanted to learn about git internals.

## Contributing

For now, use github for issues and patches. Maybe we'll switch to a mailing
list later. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
